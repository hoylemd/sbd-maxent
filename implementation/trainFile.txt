Wassup, homie.
I'm about 0.5 times your height, because I'm a kid.
I'm also going to call you Mr. old guy because you're older than me.
I bet you hate that, Mr. old guy!
Do you hate that?
Dwarfs are silly.
I call the "Dorfs", and to that they day "Don't call me a Dorf."
Some people say "hello there." and I don't like that.
Goodbye, Dr.
