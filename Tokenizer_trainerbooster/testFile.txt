Recovery excitement brings Mexican markets to life .
$BODY
Emerging evidence that Mexico's economy was back on the recovery track sent Mexican markets into a buzz of excitement Tuesday , with stocks closing at record highs and interest rates at 19-month lows .
" Mexico has been trying to stage a recovery since the beginning of this year and it's always been getting ahead of itself in terms of fundamentals , " said Matthew Hickman of Lehman Brothers in New York .
" Now we're at the point where the fundamentals are with us . The history is now falling out of view . "
That history is one etched into the minds of all investors in Mexico : an economy in crisis since December 1994 , a free-falling peso and stubbornly high interest rates .
This week , however , second-quarter gross domestic product was reported up 7.2 percent , much stronger than most analysts had expected . Interest rates on governent Treasury bills , or Cetes , in the secondary market fell on Tuesday to 23.90 percent , their lowest level since Jan . 25 , 1995 .
The stock market's main price index rallied 77.12 points , or 2.32 percent , to a record 3,401 .79 points , with volume at a frenzied 159.89 million shares .
Confounding all expectations has been the strength of the peso , which ended higher in its longer-term contracts on Tuesday despite the secondary Cetes drop and expectations of lower benchmark rates in Tuesday's weekly auction .
With U . S . long-term interest rates expected to remain steady after the Federal Reserve refrained from raising short-term rates on Tuesday , the attraction of Mexico , analysts say , is that it offers robust returns for foreigners and growing confidence that they will not fall victim to a crumbling peso .
" The focus is back on Mexican fundamentals , " said Lars Schonander , head of researcher at Santander in Mexico City . " You have a continuing decline in inflation , a stronger-than-expected GDP growth figure and the lack of any upward move in U . S . rates . "
Other factors were also at play , said Felix Boni , head of research at James Capel in Mexico City , such as positive technicals and economic uncertainty in Argentina , which has put it and neighbouring Brazil's markets at risk .
" There's a movement out of South American markets into Mexico , " he said . But Boni was also wary of what he said could be " a lot of hype . "
The economic recovery was still export-led , and evidence was patchy that the
domestic consumer was back with a vengeance . Also , corporate earnings need to
grow strongly to justify the run-up in the stock market , he said .
